**Where's Waldo? RP Edition!**

**Why I built it**

I live with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a genetic eye condition that slowly erodes peripheral vision. Most days I can explain “tunnel vision” in words, but it’s hard for friends to feel what it’s like. So I recreated the childhood classic Where’s Waldo? then added a Tunnel-Vision Mode that black-outs everything except a small circle around the cursor.

The result is a two-minute toy that highlights how a task that feels trivial with normal vision becomes genuinely tricky once your field of view shrinks.

**How to play**

1. Open the game (desktop recommended) -> [here](https://menisadi.github.io/RPWaldo/)
2. Click Start. Waldo pops up in a random spot, the timer starts ticking.
3. Each time you click him, you score a point and he “teleports” elsewhere.
4. Now, flip the Tunnel-Vision switch to see how the hunt feels with restricted vision.
5. Hit Stop whenever you’ve had enough; you’ll get your final score, total time, and average seconds per click.
